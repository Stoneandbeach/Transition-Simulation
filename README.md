# Transition-Simulation
Simulating the probability distribution of the electron in the 1s-2p transition of hydrogen in a laser field

This MATLAB script simulated the probability distribution of the electron, when a hydrogen atom is subjected to a laser field, causing the electron to be excited from the 1s to the 2p level.

The script solves the Bloch equations, displaying how the Bloch vector moves on the Bloch sphere during the transition. This shows how the atom moves through a superposition of the 1s and 2p quantum states.

The script is somewhat slow to run, so please allow some time for it to complete.
